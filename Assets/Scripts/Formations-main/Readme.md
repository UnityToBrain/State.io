### How to use

1. Attach Either BoxFormation or RadialFormation on a game object.

2. If you just want gizmos, put FormationRenderer on the game object. If you want to spawn units, put ExampleArmy on the game object.

ALTERNATIVELY, just import the unity package at the root of this repository and throw one of the prefabs in the scene.

#### Drop a star if you found it useful :)
